# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. Using data from the Titanic dataset, the model identifies key survival factors and makes predictions using a Random Forest Classifier.

Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle's Titanic competition, which includes passenger information such as age, gender, class, and family relations.

Features Used

The following features were selected to train the model:

Pclass (Passenger class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex (Gender: male or female)

SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)

Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

RandomForestClassifier
